# Cognitive Assessment Games

A collection of interactive cognitive assessment games built with Python and Pygame to test and train different aspects of memory and reaction time.

## üéÆ Games Included

### 1. Memory Retention Game (`MemoryRetention.py`)
A classic memory matching game where players flip cards to find matching pairs of shapes and colors.
- **Objective**: Match all pairs of identical icons
- **Skills Tested**: Visual memory, pattern recognition, concentration
- **Features**: Animated card reveals, randomized board layout, automatic game restart

### 2. Reaction Time Test (`ReactionTime.py`)
Test your reflexes with this simple but effective reaction time measurement tool.
- **Objective**: Click as quickly as possible when the screen turns green
- **Skills Tested**: Reaction time, alertness, hand-eye coordination
- **Features**: Random delay intervals, precise millisecond timing, visual feedback

### 3. Verbal Memory Test (`VerbalMemory.py`)
Challenge your ability to remember and recall sequences of words.
- **Objective**: Memorize word sequences and type them back correctly
- **Skills Tested**: Verbal memory, sequential recall, typing accuracy
- **Features**: Progressive difficulty, scoring system, immediate feedback

### 4. Short Term Memory Test (`ShortTermMemory.py`)
*(Referenced in menu but file not provided)*
Test your short-term memory capabilities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cognitive-assessment-games.git
cd cognitive-assessment-games
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Games

#### Option 1: Main Menu (Recommended)
Run the main menu to access all games:
```bash
python Menu.py
```

#### Option 2: Individual Games
Run games directly:
```bash
python MemoryRetention.py    # Memory matching game
python ReactionTime.py       # Reaction time test
python VerbalMemory.py       # Verbal memory test
```

## üéØ How to Play

### Memory Retention Game
1. Click on cards to reveal their icons
2. Try to remember the location of matching pairs
3. Match all pairs to win and advance to the next level
4. The game automatically restarts with a new layout

### Reaction Time Test
1. Click "Click to Start" to begin
2. Wait for the screen to turn from yellow to green
3. Click as quickly as possible when you see "Click NOW!"
4. Your reaction time will be displayed in milliseconds
5. Click to play again

### Verbal Memory Test
1. Click "Start Game" to begin
2. Memorize the sequence of words displayed
3. Type each word in the input box when prompted
4. Progress through increasingly difficult sequences
5. View your final score and choose to play again
